        </h1> <!--We can nest element inside one another. Eg: h1 inside body, a tag inside p, etc-->
        <p class="first"> <!--But classes and ids are attributes that can be used on all elements. They are used to name elements and 
        hence helps to identify each element for styling and also to perform DOM manipulation-->

            You can learn JavaScript without HTML and CSS, but for dOM manipulation it's useful to have some basic ideas of HTML & CSS.

             anchor element using href(hypertext reference) attribute. In href we put the URL where this link should point to.
             Anchor element is an inline element. ie It flows in line with the rest of the text. Not start in next line -->

        <h2>Another Heading</h2><!-- h2 is a block element. It starts in next line. Not as rest of previous line. -->

        <p class="second">Just another paragraph.</p> <!-- Difference between classes and ids is that ids must be unique. Each id
        can only be used once on the page whereas classes can be used over and over again. It's better to use classes. -->
